# Welcome to my GitHub page!

On this page, you will find a collection of my personal projects and coding experiments. Each project has its own dedicated folder, which contains all of the relevant code and documentation.

To get started, take a look at the list of projects below:

[ ] - Project 1: A simple to-do list app built with React
[ ] - Project 2: A weather app that shows the current temperature and forecast for a given location
[ ] - Project 3: A machine learning model that can identify different species of flowers

If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to open an issue on the relevant project page or contact me directly. I'm always happy to help and learn from others.

Thank you for visiting my page!
